# libomt

libomt is a C wrapper for the libomnet library.

libomt uses the .NET Native AOT Deployment to build a native shared library with C exports

## Getting Started

Prebuilt binaries of libomt for both Windows and MacOS is available in the Releases page for libomtnet here:
https://github.com/openmediatransport/libomtnet/releases

## Requirements

libvmx shared library (included in the prebuilt binaries)

.NET 8.0 for Windows, Linux or MacOS (.NET not required unless compiling from source)

## Compiling

1. Setup a folder structure with both libomtnet and libomt as follows:
   
[root]

/libomtnet

/libomt

2. The build process will reference and build the .NET Standard library in the ../libomtnet folder
3. Run the build script for the desired platform from the build directory.
4. A shared library and a .lib file should be generated in the platform native directory.
On Windows this is usually bin\Release\net8.0\win-x64\native

## Using the library in your project

1. Include the libomt.h file in your C/C++ application
2. Add the libomt.lib library

Note: libomtnet.dll is not needed as it is automatically built into the libomt shared library.
